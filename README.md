# Fully-Convolutional-Binary-Classifier-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-grapes
This project is inserted in the context of the larger, EU funded, CANOPIES project.

The objectives of this project were to:

  •  build a dataset of patches obtained by cropping the full-images provided by the CANOPIES team;
  
  •  design and train a model on the dataset created that could work on inputs of variable sizes;
  
  •  evaluate this model's performance at detecting and localizing anomalies in pictures of grapes;
  
  •  compare this model's performance with the autoencoder model.

The dataset is provided in the Canopies-data folder, it containes patches of different sizes.
The implementation of the project is provided and commented in the colab file (.ypnb).
The implementation is also provided in .py format.
